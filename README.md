Welcome to wueste MLP (Modular Live Performer)
MLP is a modular environment for live improvisation in electronic music. Built with Pure Data and Python, it runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a dedicated controller — but it is fully cross-platform and works on any operating system.

To run Molipe, please download and install Pure Data (Vanilla):

Note for Linux users:
Pure Data must be run with sudo in order to allow the patch to open new subpatches.

To start Molipe, open the file mother.pd. From within mother.pd, you can load various patches.
