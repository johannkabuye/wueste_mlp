#X text 23 52 The "DIET-DRUM-SEQ" module is a drum sequencer with a focus on live performing preprepared patterns. It has mute funktions for each instrument and a stutter effect. It has eight instruments.;
#X text 23 102 NOTE: The patterns are saved and loaded from the main patch. Many instances of the "DIET-DRUM-SEQ" can be loaded but they all use the same patterns. If a pattern is changed in one instances it also changes the patterns for all the other instances.;
